<!-- <p>If you're choosing a web design agency, it helps to know more than just the costs, their clients and the work they'd do for you. So here are a few things about the way we work.</p> -->

<h4>Project Management</h4>

<!--  <p>We will endevour to answer questions and explain details of our workflow, ensuring that tasks are completed and deadlines are met,</p> -->


<p>We use a modular / <a href="#">'Agile'</a> approach to projects, avoiding over planning and sticking rigorously to that plan throughout the whole process, instead we conduct an iterative process, constantly amending and responding quickly to feedback and ideas from our clients, their users and other factors that require change.</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>



<p>We save all communications, either by e-mail or within google documents so that it can be shared with team members, this is useful for reporting bugs or requests refer to exact page URLs, messages, share screenshots etc</p>

 <p>But we also recognise the value of phone call to discuss the big picture, or to give advice, and you are welcome to call us on xxx xxxx xxx at any time (weekdays, 9am - 6pm).</p>

<p>We agree a clear, concise list of the things you're asking for in a project, and set up checklists with all the details that are needed to provide them. So the checklists are our project plan - one that is flexible, collaborative, ever-changing, but ever-accurate.</p>

<!-- <h4>Browser Testing</h4>

<p>Websites must be tested before they're launched to make sure that: they display well on all leading browsers, on different platforms and devices; that users find what they're looking for and don't get frustrated with registration forms; that hyperlinks work and code doesn't fail; and so on. There are many different ways of organising testing and we're comfortable with most of them: using external companies, planning in-house testing at our end, or using you and your colleagues to test our work. The one thing we believe is that the best testers are people who think like your website users, not like web developers.</p>

<p>We always plan for a period of testing at the end of the project, after all possible changes have been made to the site, all content added, and all design polishing complete, giving us good time to run a series of automated tests and have human beings sense-check the site pages. It's perfectly possible to test everything as you go along, after every significant addition or change is made to the site, but it adds to the time and the cost of the project. Most of our clients prefer it to be done in one distinct, blocked-out period.</p> -->


<h4>Responsive / Adaptive Web Design</h4>

<p>The web is not a static environment like print, there are many devices and there will be many more. It is impracticle to recreate a website with different code and graphics for an ever expaning myriad of devices. The solution is a design that can recognise and shrink or expand to fit the device.</p> 

<p>Having said that you can still only realistically target a certain number, so whilst we try to make designs work on as many devices as possible it will not be realistic to make them as desired on all. By default we target the obvious choices e.g. Desktop ( resolutions ), iPhone, iPad, Android</p>  

 

<h4>Timelines</h4>

<p>clear list of the tasks that make up a project - avoid misunderstandings later. 

The planning stage includes:

Collating documents: written brief, standard questionnaire and an site audit of your old site.
A kick-off meeting to fill in holes and ensure we understand your requirements.
A definition of your target users and what you want them to get out of visiting your site.
A hierarchical sitemap listing the pages on your site, with brief notes on the layout, content and functionality of each.
A Cost Agreement itemising the work requested and the time involved in each.
Setting up checklists of project tasks so you can monitor our progress.
Setting of proposed milestone dates leading to the site launch.</p>


<p>Resource gathering

Collecting the text, images, data and files.

We don't expect you to have every paragraph and photo set in stone before we start building your site. But the more 'real' content we can get at the beginning, the better a job our designer can do, and the fewer surprises there will be along the way.

Copy

We explain how text is best formatted to supply to us; you give us as much as you can for the homepage, key landing pages and a handful of subsidiary pages, plus straplines, pull quotes, captions or other elements to be used across the site. We can also give suggestions at an early stage on suitable web copy guidelines.

Images

You may have your own image resources, or we can work together to source them from online libraries or photographers.

Files

We discuss appropriate formatting for files, how to name them and how to get them to us.</p>

<p>
  Graphic design

rough sketches, first concepts and final designs.

We start by creating wireframes (rough sketches) of layouts for each agreed page template, and modify them based on your feedback. This isn't just a design tool - it helps us to organise information and remember to include all the functionality you want for your site.

Then, starting with the homepage and a standard subsidiary page template, we send you JPEG designs for review, based on the wireframes and using the text and images you've supplied.

You tell us what you like and don't like about them, and we keep working until you're happy. And we create alternative layouts for other parts of the site as agreed.


</p>



<p>Layout build

turning the layout designs into robust, accessible web pages.

Using our Photoshop designs as starting points, we create fully standards-compliant website layouts using HTML and CSS, which will work across all major browsers, platforms and devices. The designs are sliced up, optimised and compressed and images placed on the webpages.

Empty pages are set up for all parts of the website, as per the sitemap, and the navigation system (menu, sub-menu, online sitemap and 'breadcrumbs') is created and linked to the pages so you can browse the site.</p>

<p>Content

fleshing out the pages with text, photos & downloads.

Now it's time to flesh out the website. On most projects we take responsibility for laying out one set of pages, and let you make further amendments using a Content Management System (CMS).

Copy formatting

Copy you've supplied is converted from Word documents to clean, valid XHTML and inserted into the database, which feeds it to the website and allows changes to be made via the CMS.

Images

Photos are cropped, optimised and uploaded, to make sure they fit the website layout, display at high quality but still download quickly.

Downloads

Documents for download are converted to PDF or other web-friendly formats and uploaded to the server.

</p>




<p>Functionality

designing forms, archives, calendars, maps etc: making your website do things.

 code the functionality that makes your website interact with your users and cut down your administration time. This might include a discussion forum, document libraries, a product catalogue, video galleries, location mapping, social networking feeds, an event calendar, a user registration system or online payments.

We source, recommend and install scripting libraries (such as jQuery) and the best plugins to enhance your site's front-end. Registration forms can capture data from your visitors, e-mail it to you and save it in a database for later reporting. And custom filter tools can let your users easily browse your archives.

We also install the best third-party tools wherever appropriate, such as Google Site Search to index all of your site's public content.</p>


<p>Changes

incorporating your revisions and new ideas.

On most projects, your needs change somewhat as the website takes shape, new ideas occur, new content is written, and you and your colleagues review our work and have reactions to ideas that seemed good on paper. So there is invariably a wave of changes to be implemented once the original brief is met.

checklisting system, and the ability of our own CMS to annotate pages with "Post-it" comments, we assemble a list of changes requested by all parties - including our own graphic designer who carefully audits the fleshed-out website and adds styling where needed. Our developers work through the checklists until all requests have been met.</p>

<p>Quality assurance

testing, proofreading and final polishing.

This is our time: once all content is signed-off and all changes from your end are complete, we reserve at least a week to test and polish the site prior to launch. This includes:

reviewing the original Cost Agreement and ensuring we have met every request;
testing functionality throughout the site, and using any agreed third-party testing companies;
testing the site layout on all major browsers and platforms, and ensuring the code meets legal, accessibility and usability criteria;
evaluating the content for its pickup by search engines;
proofreading copy for typos, grammar and spelling errors, or appropriate length and tone;
cleaning of code, removing any developer comments, organising and labelling code blocks and ensuring that future maintenance will be easy.
It's in our interests as much as yours to ensure our latest work is launched only after a thorough quality review.</p>

<p>Launch

publishing the site and telling people about it.

Once your site is signed off at both ends, we do a number of things to launch and publicise it.

repoint your domain name to the new site (this can take 24-72 hours, but is seamless);
re-register you with leading search engines to draw their attention to the new site;
submit a specially formatted sitemap to Google, Bing and Yahoo to aid their indexing of the new pages;
shut down the test version of the site we've
publicise the launch on your, and our, social networking channels;
add it to our own portfolio;
liaise with you about an HTML press release or other notifications.</p>

<p>Maintenance

ongoing support, monitoring & updates.

A website needs constant care and attention to ensure that standards are maintained and content kept fresh. We offer a number of services to ensure ongoing quality assurance, including backup solutions, server uptime reports, broken link scans, search engine ranking analysis, and content analysis.

For some of these we make use of the best automated services available to webmasters, which we have thoroughly reviewed and tested. But you may want hands-on support from us as well: formatting of copy or image updates, coding of new functionality, or having us run a customer helpdesk on your behalf to respond to technical queries.
