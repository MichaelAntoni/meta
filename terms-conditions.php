2. Cost Agreements and Application of these Terms
2.1
2.2 
These Terms (as amended by us from time to time) apply to and shall be incorporated 
into the Contract (and thereby the Cost Agreement). The Cost Agreement constitutes an 
invitation by us to provide the Services specified in it on these Terms to you. When you 
sign and return the Cost Agreement to us this constitutes an offer by you to purchase 
the Services on the basis of the Cost Agreement and these Terms. When we contact 
you to accept your offer, or begin work on the Services this shall establish the Contract 
between us. 
The Cost Agreement represents our reasonable efforts to predict the course of the 
Services to meet your needs based on the information you have provided to us. Whilst 
we aim to make the Cost Agreement as accurate as possible (and in the most we 
achieve this), if the progress and duration of the Services is longer or shorter than we 
anticipated e.g. as a result of you requesting an additional service or the information 
from you not being accurate, then  the final charges may be revised upwards or 
downwards and we reserve the right to amend our Fees accordingly. Our commitment is 
to inform you of any variations to the plan (and the reasons for them) as they occur such 
that any changes to our Fees, or the overall Costs do not come as a surprise.   
2.3
2.4 
Any additional Fees and/or Costs will be calculated in accordance with clause 3. These 
Fees will be recorded during the Services and billed to you at your next billing stage or 
at the end of the Services.  We will try to advise you of these additional Fees when we 
become aware of them and, where possible, before we actually incur them. 
We do not charge for our first meeting with you where you are a new client, however if 
you choose to work with us we reserve the right to charge you additional Fees for any 
subsequent meetings, travel and planning time (including for any meetings once the 
Project is completed and we are maintaining your website).  
3. Fees
3.1 We bill on an hourly basis of £65 per hour for the  following types of work: website 
design, website development / database programming, consultancy, content 
management and project management.  Graphic design and some other services may, 
at our discretion, be billed at £50 per hour. Our Cost Agreement is based on this Fee
structure and any additional Services provided to you will be similarly calculated. When 
carrying out support work our time is billed in 10  minute units if you have a support 
package with us.  If you do not have a support package with us then our time is billed in 
30 minute units. 
3.2 In certain cases (at our sole discretion) we use third parties to provide services  to 
you; Our Fees are exclusive of third party fees and third parties may quote for services 
at different rates.  Where we need to instruct a third party to carry out work for you and 
there will be an additional cost to you we will obtain fee estimates from them and agree 
these fees separately with you, prior to instructing the third party to commence work.
Where we use a third party at no additional cost to you we will not discuss this with you 
and we shall be permitted to use third parties to provide services as we see fit. 
3.3 All Fees and Costs quoted to you are exclusive of any Value Added Tax for which you 
shall be additionally liable at the applicable rate from time to time. 4. Our billing procedure
4.1 Our billing policy (in the absence of any alternative agreement) is as follows: 
4.1.1 Where the Services to be provided relate to design  work and the  invoice total 
exceeds £5,000 we will invoice 50% of the total shown on the Cost Agreement for 
the Services in advance for which we require payment by return. The next 25% of 
the total cost shall be payable on initial delivery of the Consulting Outputs and the 
final 25% shall be payable on launch of the Consulting Outputs  and the project 
therefore being completed; or  
4.1.2
4.1.3
Where the invoice is otherwise than for design work, or for design work under 
£5000 we shall invoice 50% of the total shown on the Cost Agreement for the 
Services in advance for which we require payment by return and the balance will 
be invoiced on Project completion; or 
where the invoice total is £1,000 or less, we will invoice the total for the Services 
on project completion;  
4.1.4 Where the Cost Agreement is for ongoing maintenance, we will invoice monthly, 
quarterly, or annually as agreed in writing with you. 
4.2 Additional Costs and Fees incurred will be invoiced to you on a monthly basis for work 
done during the preceding month until completion of the Services. 
4.3 Fees for hosting or website maintenance are billed in advance, usually quarterly. 
4.4 We reserve the right to ask you to provide us with money on account in advance of us 
entering into any agreement with a third party to provide services to you. 
5. Our payment terms
5.1
5.2 
5.3 
You shall pay each invoice submitted to you by us in full, and in cleared funds, within 30 
days of receipt.  
Without prejudice to any other right or remedy that we may have, if you fail to pay us on 
the due date we may: 
(a) charge interest on such sum from the due date for payment at the annual rate of [4]% 
above the base lending rate from time to time of Barclays bank plc, accruing on a daily 
basis and being compounded quarterly until payment is made, whether before or after 
any judgment. The Supplier may claim interest under the Late Payment of Commercial 
Debts (Interest) Act 1998; and 
(b) suspend all Services until payment has been made in full. 
Time for payment shall be of the essence in the Contract.  
6. Provision of material
6.1 Fees and Costs are estimated on the assumption that material for publication (text and 
images) is supplied to us in digital (computer file) form.  If we are required to convert 
material from hard copy, via scanning or typing, extra Fees will apply at the standard 
hourly rate. 
6.2 We accept digital material in the following formats:  Microsoft Word or other common 
text formats, copy by e-mail, HTML, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, Adobe PDF, Adobe 
Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft 
PowerPoint. 
6.3 All text should be supplied to us with a minimum of formatting, other than  line and 
paragraph breaks.  Please avoid the use of boldface, italics or other formatting styles, 
and tables or other layout tools, as these will be added by us during the design process. 6.5 Text supplied to us should be final version.  We reserve the right to charge for extra time 
spent amending text following transfer to your website. You are responsible for proofing 
any text provided by you and we shall not be responsible for any mistakes or omissions 
once you have given final approval of any wording. 
7. Cancellation and modification
7.1 When instructed by you, we assign Staff to carry out the Services.  As a result, we plan 
the use of our Staff and resources months in advance and turn down work for which we 
do not have adequate resources.  Cancellation by you therefore causes us loss and so
we reserve the right to charge you as follows: 
7.1.1 100% charge for all work actually done and Costs incurred at the date of 
cancellation; and/or 
7.1.2 50% charge for any Fees budgeted and cancelled by you with less than 1 months 
notice;  
7.2 In the case of ongoing hosting or maintenance contracts, we require 30 days notice for 
cancellation unless stated otherwise in the Cost Agreement. 
7.3 Postponement of work by you will be treated as a cancellation (as we will have already 
made allowances to keep dates free) and will mean we have the right to charge you in 
accordance with sub clause 7.1.  
7.4 We are happy to discuss changes and modifications of your instructions to us at any 
time, but you accept that such changes or modifications may result in our need to vary 
our Fees and Costs which have been included in the Cost Agreement.  We will always 
try and confirm such changes in writing. 
7.5 Substantial changes may require completion of the Services to be significantly delayed 
because of our need to reallocate resources. In this situation  we reserve the right to 
cancel the Services and recover our Fees and Costs  as described in sub clause 7.1 
above.  We will discuss rescheduling the new Services with you for which we will issue 
you with a new Cost Agreement. 
8. Termination
8.1
8.2 
8.3 
Either you or we may (without limiting any of our other remedies) at any time terminate 
the Contract by giving written notice to each other if (a) the other commits any material 
breach of these Terms and Conditions and (if capable of remedy) fails to remedy the 
breach within seven days after being required by written notice to do so, or (b) either of 
us goes into liquidation, or (in the case of an individual) becomes bankrupt, makes a 
voluntary arrangement with his or its creditors or (in the case of a firm)has a receiver or 
administrator appointed. 
All payments payable to us under the Contract shall become due immediately on 
termination of the Contract, despite any other provision. This condition is without 
prejudice to any right to claim for interest under  statute, or any such right under the 
Contract. 
This clause 8.3 only applies to you if we arrange the hosting of your website. In the 
event of cancellation of your contract or should Square Eye enter into an event of 
insolvency (with no reasonable chance of recovery) we will provide the following to you 
within 5 working days of your initial request, or on a single subsequent date agreed 
between us: 
8.3.1     A single copy of all web pages, images, and other documents on your site, 
excluding any access details to databases not used solely by you (including but 
not limited to access to our CMS) 
8.3.2     A copy of all documents, images or other files uploaded to our client storage 
area via our CMS 8.4 
8.3.3     An export to SQL, MS Access or MS Excel of your data held in any databases 
attached to the website 
8.3.4  Whether or not your domain name has been  registered through us, you will 
retain full legal control of it and where it has been registered through us, we will 
assist in the transfer of your domain to a registrar of your choice. 
There will be no charge for the one-off supply of files and data under clause 8.3;  any 
requests for additional exports, or for exports in other formats, will be billed at our hourly 
rate and scheduled as a normal work request. 
9. Liability
9.1
9.2 
9.3 
The following provisions set out our entire financial liability (including any liability for the 
acts or omissions of our employees, agents and third party sub-contractors) to you in 
respect of (a) any breach of the Contract; (b) any use made by you of the Services, the 
Consulting Outputs or any part of them; and (c) any representation, statement or tortious 
act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with the Contract. 
All warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or common law are, to the 
fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the Contract but nothing in these Terms 
excludes our liability (a) for death or personal injury caused by the Supplier's negligence; 
or (b) for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. 
Subject to condition 9.2: 
(a) We shall not be liable, whether in tort (including for negligence or breach of statutory 
duty), contract, misrepresentation or otherwise for (i) loss of profits; or (ii) loss of 
business; or (iii) depletion of goodwill or similar losses; or(iv) loss of anticipated savings; 
or (v) loss of goods; or(vi) loss of contract; or (vii) loss of use; or (viii) loss or corruption 
of data or information; or (ix) any special, indirect, consequential or pure economic loss, 
costs, damages, charges or expenses. 
(b) Our total liability in contract, tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), 
misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise, arising in connection with the performance or 
contemplated performance of the Contract shall be limited to the price paid for the 
Services. 
9.4
9.5 
We shall not be liable to you or be deemed to be in breach of our obligations to you by 
reason of any delay in performing, or any failure to perform, any of our obligations in 
completing the Services, if the delay or failure was due to any cause beyond our 
reasonable control. 
From time to time we use third party suppliers to assist with the Services.  In addition we 
resell services including (but not limited to) server space, domain names and email 
addresses from third party suppliers. As is the nature with services of this type they do, 
from time to time, temporarily stop working  or other problems may occur. We do not 
accept any responsibility for the failure or otherwise of any services provided by a third 
party. 
10. Delivery of consulting outputs and Intellectual Property Rights
10.1 Where applicable, once the Services have been provided the Consulting Outputs will be 
delivered to you provided you have paid all Fees and Costs in full. 
10.2 Any of our IPRs we have in the Consulting Outputs shall be assigned to you  (to the 
extent that they are required to be assigned to permit you to make use of the Consulting 
Outputs) provided that you have paid in full all Fees and Costs for the Services due to 
us. 
10.3 If you require formal assignment of any of the intellectual property rights to be transferred 10.4
to you under clause 10.2 you need to prepare the necessary documentation at your own 
cost, which we will complete and return to you providing such assignment is  in our 
opinion necessary and  reasonable and you pay our reasonable costs for having the 
documentation reviewed. 
We reserve the right to: 
10.4.1 add a discreet accreditation for Square Eye, with a hyperlink where appropriate, 
to websites or print materials (e.g. brochures) of our creation.  We may however 
waive this right in return for a small fee; and 
10.4.2  use designs and references to the work that we have done for you in our online 
portfolio or via other marketing methods. 
10.5 For the avoidance of doubt:- 
10.5.1 we are deemed to have been granted a license by you for all of your IPRs used  
by us in connection with the Services. You confirm that the use of your IPRs will 
not infringe the copyright or other rights of any third party and you will indemnify 
us against any loss, damages, costs, expenses or other claims arising from such 
infringement: 
10.5.2  the property and any copyright or other intellectual property rights in our IPRs 
belong to us and you shall have no rights in our IPRs except for:- 
   10.5.2.1 any use which we specifically authorise when providing the Services 
(and in that case only for the purpose of carrying out the Services and 
not after completion of the Services); and
   10.5.2.2 insofar as we are required to assign any rights pursuant to sub clause
10.2. 
10.5.3  we shall remain the sole legal and beneficial owners of our content management 
system at all times, save that we may (at our sole discretion) grant you a non 
exclusive license of the system.
11. General
11.1 The Cost Agreement and these Terms constitute all the arrangements on which we will 
both operate during the Services.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in
entering into the Contract it does not rely on any  undertaking, promise, assurance, 
statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether in writing or not) of any 
person (whether party to this agreement or not) relating to the subject matter of this 
agreement other than as expressly set out in the Contract. 
11.2
11.3
Any variation of the Contract shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of both the 
parties. 
Any notice required or permitted to be given by either of us to the other under these 
Terms should be in writing addressed to the other party at its registered office or 
principle place of business or such other address as at the relevant time has been 
notified pursuant to this provision to the party giving their notice and delivered by hand, 
or sent by first class or recorded delivery post or sent via email (to such email address 
as each party nominates).  
11.3 No failure or delay by either of us in exercising any of our rights under the Cost 
Agreement or these Terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of that right, nor any waiver 
by either of us of any breach of the Cost Agreement or these Terms by the other shall be 
considered as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision. 
11.4 Neither party intends any of the terms of the Contract  to be enforceable by any third 
party pursuant to the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. 
11.5 The Contract and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its 
subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed 
by and construed in accordance with the law of England. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that 
arises out of or in connection with the Contract or its subject matter or formation 
(including non-contractual disputes or claims).

            <p class="span8">
              Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
