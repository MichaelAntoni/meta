<p>Modular - pay as you go - see how things go - constant communication - about where we are and what we are doing. no surprises, client to be invovled during many steps along the way. A good idea can come from anyone involved in the process and we dont want to miss out on that. A sense of ownership - Use logic and business goals as much as possible to drive design - mixed with intuition. A good idea is a good idea. </p>



            <p>Q: How much does a website cost?</p> 

            <p>A: Anywhere between £200 and £200,000 depending on your needs, approach and agency.</p>

<p>So many factors determine the time and cost of a website project, most agencies won't give you an idea of price without speaking to you first. You might want a "sign-up form" on your site. But one that just captures e-mail addresses, or names too? Or full company details and answers to a series of multiple choice questions?</p>

<p>Are the answers e-mailed to you, or logged in a database, or both? Or fed through to a third-party mailing list service?</p> 

<p>Does the form have required fields, and check to make sure phone numbers and postcodes are formatted correctly?</p> 

<p>Is it secure against hackers? Is online payment involved? Is it to look simple, or slick and user-friendly? Will you amend it regularly? How much testing is needed?</p>

<p>The work involved in a single "sign-up form" might range from half an hour to several days; so you can see how the cost of a whole website design and build process can vary enormously.</p>

<p>The kind of projects we usually undertake have budgets between £2,500 and £15,000 + VAT for the design and build, plus a budget for ongoing support and maintenance. Ongoing hosting, support and maintenance packages range from £30 to £250 + VAT / month.</p>

<p>If you're on a tight budget, we can still discuss your needs and point you to a good solution.</p>
